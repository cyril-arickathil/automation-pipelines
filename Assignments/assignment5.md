# Assignment5: Handling Tables in Playwright

## Instructions

1. **Table Interaction**
   - Write test cases to interact with tables on the page.
   - Locate a row and use the **edit** functionality to modify its data.
   - Use the **save** action and add assertions to verify the changes are reflected in the table.

2. **Filter Functionality**
   - Write test cases to use the table's filter/search feature.
   - Enter filter criteria and verify that the table displays only the matching rows.
   - Add assertions to confirm the filter works as expected.

3. **Locator Reuse**
   - Store table, row, and button locators in variables for reuse and maintainability.
