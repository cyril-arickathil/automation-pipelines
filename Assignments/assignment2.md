# Assignment2: Test Case Writing & Locator Reuse

## Instructions

1. **Write test cases** for each form on the page.
   - Interact with both the **'Inline form'** and **'Using the Grid'** sections.
   - Add **assertions** to verify expected behaviors (e.g., field values, button states).

2. **Checkbox Assertion**
   - Create an assertion to verify that the checkbox in the **'Basic form'** is selected after interaction.

3. **Locator Reuse**
   - Use variables to store locators and reuse them across your test cases for better readability and maintainability.

## Example Branch Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
git pull origin main
```

4. **Push your branch to GitHub:**

```bash
git push -u origin <your-branch-name>
```
